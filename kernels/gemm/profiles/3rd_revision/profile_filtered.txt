          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 76.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 1.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.01 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible       
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per      
          warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 54.8 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency

          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 71.3% of the total average of 76.8 cycles

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 42.4 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 1.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.02 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible       
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per      
          warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 36.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to    
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction.

          The 1.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 16. This kernel's theoretical occupancy (6.2%) is limited by the required amount of       
          shared memory.
